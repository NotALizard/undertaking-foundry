{"name": "Chapter 7: Combat", "pages": [{"name": "Combat", "type": "text", "title": {"show": false, "level": 1}, "text": {"format": 1, "content": "<h1>Chapter 7: Combat</h1><p>Combat in <em>Undertaking</em> is turn-based, and lasts until all opposing combatants are defeated, surrender, retreat, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue.</p><p>When the combat has started, all participants roll for <strong>Initiative</strong>. Using this, the order of combat is determined, and the character with the highest Initiative goes first.</p><p>Each turn, a character has <strong>Movement, </strong>an <strong>Action</strong>, a <strong>Minor Action</strong>, and a <strong>Reaction</strong>, and can add <strong>Non-Actions</strong> for flavor. Finally, you can do a <strong>Desperate Action</strong> to interrupt someone else&rsquo;s turn to do an Action.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Terminology</p><ul><li>Turn</li><ul><li>When it is a creature&rsquo;s &ldquo;turn&rdquo;, whoever controls the creature can take <strong>Actions</strong>, <strong>Minor Actions</strong>, or <strong>Move</strong> their character. Once they end their turn, the next creature in the <strong>Initiative Queue</strong> starts their turn.</li></ul><li>Round</li><ul><li>A complete circulation of the <strong>Initiative Queue</strong>.</li></ul><li>Initiative</li><ul><li>The number determining your initial placement in the Initiative Queue.</li></ul></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Rolling Initiative</p><p>When combat starts, all participants must make a Dexterity check to determine the combat <strong>Initiative Queue</strong>. The GM makes cards for each combatant, and places the card for the creature with the lowest initiative at the bottom of the Initiative Queue, and places cards with progressively higher initiatives above it until all participants are in the queue.</p><p>If a tie occurs between opposing creatures, the creature with the highest Dexterity Stat goes first. If they both have the same stat, then they both roll a D20 each until one roll is higher; the creature with the higher roll goes first.</p><p>If a tie occurs between two friendly creatures, they can choose who goes first, or use the above rules to decide.</p><p>If a new creature enters combat after the battle has started, the creature gets one Action, after which it is added to the bottom of the Initiative Queue.</p><p>Since initiative is non-static, for abilities and spells that have a duration (such as 1 minute or 1 hour), each time your turn ends you remove 6 seconds from the time remaining, meaning that a 1 minute ability or spell lasts 10 turns.</p><p>Optional:</p><ul><li>It may be easier for the GM to spread the Initiative Queue out in a line if there is enough table space so that players and the GM alike can see the turn order.</li><li>For extra drama, place them face-down the first time through combat and flip them up as each turn comes around.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Surprise</p><p>In a situation where one or more creatures is unaware of an attack, those creatures are <strong>surprised</strong>. Unless one group is being stealthy, groups automatically notice each other.</p><p>When combat starts and at least one creature is surprised, initiative is rolled and then the GM determines who is surprised by combat.</p><p><strong>Surprised</strong> creatures cannot move, take actions, minor actions, reactions, or desperate actions until the end of their first turn in combat.</p><p><br /><br /></p><h2>Your Turn</h2><p>On your turn, you can <strong>Move</strong> your character, take one <strong>Action</strong>, and/or take one <strong>Minor Action</strong>.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Movement</p><p>Most combat scenarios demand constant repositioning. Be it to stay in or out of range of an opponent, to keep close to the party&rsquo;s healer but to avoid clustering and making your party an easy target, or to line up a magic spell, movement is a must.</p><p>Movement in <em>Undertaking</em> is done in increments of 5 feet for simplicity. So if a board is used, a character with 30ft of movement can move 6 spaces.</p><p>Notice: The base rules assume that players are playing on a grid where each tile is 5ft by 5ft. While <em>Undertaking</em> can be played in a grid-less system, examples will be in increments of 5ft for consistency.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ground Speed</strong></p><p>You can walk or run up to your max ground speed each turn in increments of 5ft.</p><p></p><p><strong>Breaking Up Movement</strong></p><p>On your turn, you can move any distance on land equal to or less than your speed. You can break up this movement as well, as long as you don&rsquo;t move more than your base movement speed or less than 5ft. For example, if your speed is 30ft then you could move 10ft, cast a spell, move 15ft, and then stop. In this scenario, you used 25ft of your 30ft of movement, meaning that you could move 5ft more before having no more movement.</p><p></p><p><strong>Using Multiple Movement Speeds</strong></p><p>If you have more than one type of movement speed, such as ground and fly speed, you can switch between movement types during your move. When you switch movement, subtract any currently used movement from your new movement type&rsquo;s speed. As long as this does not mean that you have a movement of 0 or less, then you can switch to the new movement.</p><p>For example, if you have a ground speed of 30ft, a swim speed of 20ft, and a fly speed of 60ft, you can walk for 10ft into the water, swim for 10ft, then leap out and fly for 40ft more.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Terrain Traversal</p><p><strong>Cover</strong></p><p>Not all battlefields are empty, and most creatures will use that to their advantage.</p><p>If the target is half-obscured, three-quarters-obscured, or totally obscured by cover, then the creature will be more difficult to attack.</p><ul><li><strong>Half Cover</strong> grants +3 to AC.</li><li><strong>Three-Quarters Cover</strong> grants +6 to AC.</li><li>Creatures with <strong>Full Cover</strong> cannot be seen by the attacker, and can therefore not be targeted by attacks.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong></p><p>When the terrain that you are moving across is rocky, crowded, a tight squeeze, or otherwise difficult to traverse, the terrain may be considered Difficult Terrain. Traversing Difficult Terrain takes 2ft of movement speed for every 1ft moved, essentially halfing movement across it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tight Terrain</strong></p><p>Trying to move through openings considered 1 size smaller than your character. For example, if your character is a Medium-sized creature, then an opening the size of a small creature is considered Difficult Terrain when moving through it.</p><p>Openings that are 2 or more sizes smaller than your character are impossible to move through.</p><p>Check out <strong>Creature Sizes</strong> for more information on what constitutes a small or smaller opening.</p><p></p><p><strong>Moving Past Other Creatures</strong></p><p>A creature can pass through the space of another creature only if the creature is 2 or more creature sizes smaller or larger than it, or if the creature is a non-hostile.</p><p>Another creature&rsquo;s space is considered Difficult Terrain to move through, and cannot be stopped within, even while breaking up movement.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Special Forms of Movement</p><p>This book generally assumes that Movement Speed is the creature&rsquo;s Ground Speed, but other forms of movement do exist.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stealth In Combat</strong></p><p>While in combat, if a creature cannot see you, you can attempt to hide your presence from 1 or more creatures using the <strong>Hide Action</strong>. More info on this can be found in the <strong>Action</strong> section of this chapter.</p><p>Once hidden, you generally do not need to re-hide yourself until you are discovered or make yourself known, unless the Dexterity (Stealth) check for your Hide Action is less than a nearby creature&rsquo;s <strong>Awareness</strong>, at which point the creature spots you.</p><p>In combat, most creatures will be expecting ambush, and will usually see you if you step out from your hiding place. Sometimes, however, the GM might allow you to stay hidden while out of cover if, for example, the creature is heavily distracted or otherwise not expecting you. You cannot stay hidden if you make a noise or otherwise give away your position.</p><p>If the creatures that you are hiding from cannot find you because you have rolled a Dexterity (Stealth) check higher or equal to their Awareness, then they have lost track of you and cannot target you with any attacks, spells, or abilities. However, they may remember where they had last seen you and come to investigate or attempt to <strong>Blind Fire</strong> in your direction. Go to the &ldquo;<strong>Unseen Attackers and Targets</strong>&rdquo; section under the &ldquo;<strong>Attack Rolls</strong>&rdquo; section later in this chapter for more information.</p><p>If generally in your area, creatures can use the <strong>Search Action</strong> or <strong>Glance Minor Action</strong> to spot you. If they succeed, they can call out your location to other creatures for <strong>Free</strong>, giving other creatures advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to spot you if you are invisible or out of sight until you can next attempt to hide.</p><p></p><p><strong>Climb, Swim, and Crawl Speed</strong></p><ul><li><em>Climb Speed</em> is movement up or down terrain that is too steep to walk upon.</li><li><em>Swim Speed</em> is movement in any direction while in or under water.</li><li><em>Crawl Speed</em> is movement while <strong>Prone</strong>.</li></ul><p></p><p>All of these forms of movement work like moving across <strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>; each 1ft of movement takes 2ft of your movement speed.</p><p>At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, movement costs may increase or a Skill Check may be required to successfully traverse these forms of terrain under certain conditions, such as climbing wet rock, or swimming through seaweed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jumping</strong></p><p>Your Strength (Athletics) determines your jump capacity. Each foot of movement travelled in the air takes up a foot of movement on the ground.</p><ul><li>Horizontal/Long Jumps</li><ul><li>With a run-up of 10ft, you can jump a distance up to 10 + your Strength (Athletics) modifier in feet. With no run-up, you can jump up to half that distance, with a minimum of 5ft.</li></ul><li>Vertical/High Jumps</li><ul><li>With a run-up of 10ft, you can jump up to 3 + your Strength (Athletics) modifier in feet, with a minimum of 1ft. Without a run-up, you can jump up to half that distance with a minimum of 1ft.</li></ul></ul><p>Landing in Difficult Terrain requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or else you fall <strong>Prone</strong>.</p><p>If your movement ends over a gap, but next to a ledge, you can attempt to grab the ledge with a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or else slip and <strong>Fall</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Falling</strong></p><p>For every 10ft you fall, you take 5 bludgeoning damage to a maximum of 750 (1500 ft).</p><p>If you land on top of another creature, it takes falling damage equal to half the falling damage that you take. If you die from the fall, the creature only takes half of the damage that killed you and no more.</p><p></p><p><strong>Suffocation</strong></p><p>You can hold your breath for 1 + Constitution modifier rounds (minimum of 30 seconds).</p><p>When you run out of air, you begin <strong>Suffocating</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fly, Hover, and Burrow Speed</strong></p><p><em>Fly Speed</em> is movement through the air by use of a limb or magic that requires constant movement.</p><p></p><p><em>Hover Speed</em> is similar to Fly Speed, but does not require constant movement to keep aloft. Hovering creatures are considered &ldquo;flying&rdquo; for the sake of abilities that affect &ldquo;flying&rdquo; targets.</p><p></p><p><em>Burrow Speed</em> is movement through physical or magical digging and traversal through soft dirt.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, you cannot fly, hover, or burrow. As such, your Fly, Hover, and Burrow Speeds are 0ft.</p><p></p><h2>Variable Action Economy</h2><p>Some actions have different requirements depending on the context. The following are actions that have variable action costs.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Cast a Spell</strong></p><p>Most spells have a <strong>Casting Time</strong> of 1 Action, meaning that they take 1 Action to cast. However, some have a Casting Time of 1 Minor Action or 1 Reaction. See <strong>Spellcasting</strong> for more details.</p><p></p><p><strong>Using an Ability or Item</strong></p><p>Many abilities, and some magic and non-magic items, have different requirements for use. Read the details of each ability and item closely for details.</p><p></p><p><strong>Improvised Action</strong></p><p>Some actions cannot be easily defined, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that your character can&rsquo;t do them. Your only limit of actions is your imagination and your character&rsquo;s capabilities, and logic, of course. If you describe something for your character to do that doesn&rsquo;t fall under specific rules, the GM might tell you that the action can be done anyway, and tell you what kind of rolls and/or action cost to follow to complete that action.</p><p>Examples include flipping a table for cover, persuading enemies to parley, sizing-up a foe, or swinging from a chandelier; none of these have an innate action cost attached, leaving it up to the GM to decide.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Actions</p><p>On your turn, you have 1 Action. Use can spend your action on one of the following:</p><p></p><p><strong>Attack</strong></p><p>The Attack action has you make 1 melee or ranged attack with your equipped weapon. See <strong>&ldquo;Making an Attack&rdquo;</strong> for more details.</p><p>Some features grant extra uses during the Attack Action, such as multiple attacks or attacks with bonuses. Remember, <strong>Specific &gt; General</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Lesser Off-Hand Attack</strong></p><p>As part of your attack action, you may also attack with your <strong>Off-Hand Weapon</strong> <em>at disadvantage </em>as long as both of your weapons are <strong>Light</strong>. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand attack unless that modifier is negative.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grappling, Shoving, and Tripping</strong></p><p>Instead of an attack in your attack action, you can attempt to grapple, shove, or trip the target.</p><p>To grapple, shove, or trip a target, the target must be at most one size larger than you and within 5ft of you. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). Reroll on a tie.</p><p>If the target rolls higher, the target gets free and the attempt fails.</p><p>If you roll higher, the relevant following effect happens:</p><ul><li>Grapple: The target is <strong>grappled</strong>, as described in the &ldquo;<strong>Conditions</strong>&rdquo; section. You can only grapple one creature per arm.</li><li>Shove: The target is moved 5ft away from you.</li><li>Trip: The target is knocked <strong>prone</strong>, as described in the &ldquo;<strong>Conditions</strong>&rdquo; section.</li></ul><p></p><p>You can move the creature while grappling the creature at half of your speed. If the target is two or more sizes smaller than you, you can move at normal speed. You are able to attack the creature that you are grappling.</p><p>The target can use its action to attempt to escape the grapple. Repeat the above grapple roll to see if the target can escape or not.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dash</strong></p><p>Taking the Dash action doubles your movement speed for the current turn. All movement modifiers are included in this. Stealth is broken when using the Dash action.</p><p></p><p><strong>Disengage</strong></p><p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks during your turn.</p><p></p><p><strong>Self-Defense</strong></p><p>Taking the Self-Defense action causes all attack rolls made against you to have disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity (Save) checks with advantage. This lasts until your next turn or until you are otherwise incapacitated.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hide</strong></p><p>If you want to hide, and those you want to hide from cannot see you, then you can attempt to hide using a Hide action. When you take the Hide action, roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check to determine how successful you are. If a creature&rsquo;s <strong>Awareness </strong>is higher than your roll, then it notices you.</p><p>See <strong>Stealth In Combat </strong>for more details.</p><p></p><p><strong>Assist</strong></p><p>If your target can reasonably be assisted, you can take the Assist action to aid another creature in a task. When you do so, the creature gains advantage on the next skill check or attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ready an Action</strong></p><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s your turn, but you don&rsquo;t want to act quite yet. By Readying an Action, you can set aside a specific action to go off at a triggered time.</p><p>When you Ready an Action, you decide what action you want to do, and what triggers the action. You can ready any action listed in this section, and triggers can be anything determinable by the GM.</p><p>Beware, if the trigger does not trigger, your readied action is lost. This includes losing your action by technicality (&ldquo;the bandit came through the <em>window</em>, not the <em>door</em>&rdquo;), or by it becoming your turn before your action is triggered.</p><p>Your trigger cannot be based off of metagaming (&ldquo;I ready an action for when Joe attacks on the other side of the maze&rdquo;) or off of initiative (&ldquo;I ready a spell for when the Orc starts its turn&rdquo;).</p><p>When readying a spell, no matter what spell it is, you are considered to be concentrating on the spell until the action triggers or fails to trigger. For example, if you are concentrating on a spell, you must drop that spell to ready another spell, and if you are struck before the readied spell triggers, then you might lose concentration.</p><p>However, you do spend the Mana to cast the spell until it is actually triggered. So, if your readied spell is interrupted before it has a chance to cast, you do not lose the Mana that it would have taken to cast the spell.</p><p>Read the <strong>Concentration</strong> section in <strong>&ldquo;Chapter 9: Magic &amp; Spellcasting&rdquo;</strong> for more details.</p><p></p><p><strong>Search</strong></p><p>When you take the Search action, you focus entirely on searching for and finding something or someone. Generally, this requires a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, but your GM may waive this check if the objective is particularly easy to find.</p><p>If searching for a hidden creature, your check must be higher than the hidden creature&rsquo;s most recent Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p><p></p><p><strong>Action to Minor Action</strong></p><p>You can spend your Action to give yourself a 2nd Minor Action.</p><p></p><h3>Minor Actions</h3><p>Not all actions are as taxing or time-consuming as others. Minor actions cover smaller, quicker actions that you can complete without wasting your whole turn to do so.</p><p>On your turn, you have 1 Minor Action.</p><p></p><p><strong>Off-Hand Attack</strong></p><p>When you attack a creature with an Attack action and do not use a Lesser Off-Hand Attack, you also use your Minor Action to attack with your <strong>Off-Hand Weapon</strong> as long as both of your weapons are <strong>Light</strong>. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand attack unless that modifier is negative.</p><p></p><p><strong>Switching Heavy Weapons or Repeatedly</strong></p><p>It takes a minor action to switch to weapons with the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; trait.</p><p>Other weapons can be switched out once per turn as a free action, any more than that costs a minor action.</p><p></p><p><strong>Give, Take, or Trade</strong></p><p>You can give, take, or trade 1 held or easily accessible object or item with a willing creature as a Minor Action. Taking an object from a willing creature&rsquo;s messy bag might require a <strong>Search action</strong> or <strong>Glance minor action</strong>, at your GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p><p></p><p><strong>Use an Ability or Item</strong></p><p>Some abilities, and some magic and non-magic items, require 1 Minor Action to use. Read the details of each ability and item closely to confirm which is which.</p><p></p><p><strong>Glance</strong></p><p>Taking a Glance Minor Action allows you to get a rough understanding of your surroundings. This works like a Search Action in that it requires you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, however, a Glance is made at disadvantage.</p><p></p><h3>Reactions</h3><p>Some actions can only be done in response to the actions of others. Reactions allow you to act on another creature&rsquo;s turn, but only in certain situations, and only once, before regaining your Reaction next turn.</p><p></p><p><strong>Opportunity Attack</strong></p><p>When an enemy moves outside of your attack range, you can use your Reaction to attack the opponent with your current weapon before the creature moves. If you have no weapon held, you use your fists instead.</p><p></p><h3>Non-Actions</h3><p>Some things are so negligible that they don&rsquo;t have any cost in combat at all. The following Non-Actions might cost nothing, but, since each turn is considered to be 6 seconds, as stated in <strong>Initiative</strong>, the GM may limit the player&rsquo;s Non-Actions each turn in combat.</p><p></p><p><strong>Speaking, Gesturing, Flourishing</strong></p><p>You can speak, gesture, flourish, and so on, without cost. However, as stated in <strong>Improvised Action</strong>, social interaction that requires a skill check may have some cost at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p><p></p><p><strong>Switch Weapon</strong></p><p>Once per turn, you can switch weapons. Switching more than once or switching to or from a &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; weapon requires a minor action.</p><p></p><h3>Desperate Action</h3><p>Desperate Actions, unlike other mechanics, require constant vigilance. Desperate actions let you forfeit your entire next turn to take 1 Action (a &ldquo;<strong>Desperate Action&rdquo;</strong>) <em>right now</em>, pausing whomever&rsquo;s turn it is until your action is completed. Since all creatures have Desperate Actions as well, players will have to pay attention during combat if they want to stay alive.</p><p>To standardize the process of interruption, in-game time stops the moment someone says that they want to use a Desperate Action. This allows the player to describe their action based on where everyone and everything is at that exact moment.</p><p></p><p><strong>Movement</strong></p><p>If interrupting an attack, any movement that the attacker or target gains from a Desperate Action moves it after the attack, if it is still able to move.</p><p>If you use a Desperate Action to move or shove a target, the creature is not moved until after the attack, but the target gets a +2 to AC for the sake of this attack.</p><p>If you use your Desperate Action to move when being hit by an AoE that allows a Dexterity (Save) check, you gain +2 to this save.</p><p>If you use Desperate Action to use the Self-Defense action when being hit by an AoE that allows a Strength (Save) or Constitution (Save) check, you gain +2 to this save.</p><p></p><p><strong>Vision &amp; Targeting</strong></p><p>If a Desperate Action interrupts an attack and causes the target to no longer be seen or targeted by the attacker and does so without moving the target, the attack still goes off, but the attack roll is at disadvantage.</p><p>If a spell attack or ability has a Save Check and not an Attack Roll, the target has a +2 to this save.</p><p></p><p><strong>Saving a Target</strong></p><p>If a creature is being attacked and you can get to a spot between the attacker and target with your Desperate Action, then you can do so and take the attack instead. The target is unharmed, but you are automatically hit by the attack despite the Attack Roll and your Armor Class.</p><p>If there is not at least 5ft between the attacker and target, you can take a non-action to attempt to shove the creature 5ft away from the attack before you take the attack.</p><p></p><p>Hindering and Negating Attacks</p><p>If you can see an attacker, its target, and the ranged attack, you can attempt to shoot the projectile out of the air as a Desperate Action.</p><p></p><p><em>Stopping Ranged Weapon Attacks: </em>If the projectile is a ranged weapon attack, you can attempt to shoot the projectile out of the air with a ranged weapon or melee thrown weapon attack of your own if the projectile is within your weapon&rsquo;s range.</p><p>The attacker makes the attack roll for the ranged weapon attack; do not reroll the attack roll if it has already been rolled. Make an attack roll with your ranged weapon. If your attack roll is higher than the projectile&rsquo;s attack roll, you are able to shoot the projectile out of the air, negating the attack.</p><p></p><p><em>Stopping Ranged Spell Attacks:</em> If the projectile is a ranged spell attack, you can attempt to counter the spell with a ranged spell attack of your own if the spell projectile is within range of your spell&rsquo;s range.</p><p>If your spell is of lower level than the spell that you are attempting to counter, then this automatically fails and the spell is used. The attacker makes the attack roll for the ranged spell attack; do not reroll the attack roll if it has already been rolled. Make an attack roll with your ranged spell. If your attack roll is higher than the spell projectile&rsquo;s attack roll, you are able to shoot the spell out of the air, negating the spell attack.</p><p></p><p><strong>Interrupting Interruptions</strong></p><p>Desperate Actions cannot be interrupted. In the case of Desperation being called out during a Desperate Action, the second Desperate Action happens directly after the first one.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Making an Attack</p><p>To make an attack, in short, you do the following:</p><ul><li>Choose a target. Be sure to check if the target is within range.</li><li>Check for modifiers. Be it cover, advantage or disadvantage, or other effects, your result could be very different after considering these factors.</li><li>Roll to hit. Roll your D20 and apply modifiers.</li><li>(If you hit) Roll damage. Damage dice changes depending on the attack.</li><li>(If you hit) Resolve other effects. Some spells, attacks, items, and abilities have effects other than just dealing damage.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Attack Rolls</p><p>Attack rolls determine if your attack hits or misses. This random chance is simulated by rolling a D20 and applying the appropriate modifiers.</p><p>If the roll + modifiers equals or exceeds the Armor Class (AC) of the target, the attack hits, and you move on to dealing damage. Otherwise the attack misses and your attack is over.</p><p></p><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p><p>Typically, an attack roll has two primary modifiers, the <strong>Ability Modifier</strong>, and the <strong>Proficiency Modifier</strong>.</p><p></p><p><em>Ability Modifier: </em>The ability modifier accounts for your general stats.</p><p>Melee weapon attacks add your Strength modifier, and ranged weapon attacks add your Dexterity modifier. Some weapons have traits that break this general rule.</p><p>Some spells also require an attack roll. &ldquo;Spell Attacks&rdquo; use your <strong>Spell Attack Modifier</strong>. This modifier is determined by your class. See &ldquo;<strong>Spellcasting</strong>&rdquo; for more details.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em>Proficiency Bonus: </em>Your proficiency bonus accounts for your specific trained skill in certain weaponry.</p><p>You add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls when you have proficiency with the weapon you are wielding.</p><p>Spell attack rolls always add proficiency bonus.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Critical Fails and Critical Hits</strong></p><p>If you roll a 1 on an attack roll, you rolled a &ldquo;Critical Fail.&rdquo; The attack misses, regardless of any modifiers or the target&rsquo;s AC.</p><p>If you roll a 20 on an attack roll, you rolled a &ldquo;Critical Hit.&rdquo; The attack hits, regardless of any modifiers or the target&rsquo;s AC. In addition, the attack does extra damage, as explained in the &lsquo;Damage Rolls&rsquo; section.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Unseen Attackers and Targets</p><p>When you try to attack a target that you cannot see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is referred to as &ldquo;Blind Firing.&rdquo;</p><p>If the target is not where you had specified, the GM will say that you missed, but will not specify if you had correctly guessed the target&rsquo;s location or not.</p><p>When attacking a creature that cannot see you, you have advantage of the attack rolls against it.</p><p>Attack rolls while hidden gives away your location.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Melee Attacks</p><p>Generally dealt by melee weapons, touch spells, or unarmed attacks, melee attacks generally have a 5ft reach. In other words, melee attacks only hit creatures within 5ft of the attacker.</p><p>Some weapons and creatures, particularly the larger ones, have melee attacks with a larger reach.</p><p>You can still make melee attacks while <strong>unarmed</strong>. The statistics for unarmed strikes are shown in the &ldquo;<strong>Weapons</strong>&rdquo; section.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Ranged Attacks</p><p>Generally dealt by ranged weapons and ranged spells, ranged attacks have varying ranges and work slightly differently from melee attacks.</p><p></p><p><strong>Range</strong></p><p>Each ranged weapon or attack has its own range. Any creature within the specified range can be hit by the ranged attack.</p><p>Many ranged attacks have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, inside of which attacks are handled normally. The larger number is the long range, which can still be done, but at disadvantage.</p><p>Making ranged attacks at targets within 5ft of you gives the attack disadvantage.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Damage and Healing</p><p>It is safe to assume that if an adventurer goes spelunking into the deep, dark unknown cave, explores underwater wreckage, or pisses off a roving band of monsters, they are liable to get hurt, injured, or killed.</p><p>An adventurer&rsquo;s path is always riddled with the risk of wounds or injury, and some of them might even be enough to kill them.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Hit Points</p><p>All creatures and characters have Hit Points, which are a measure of their general hardiness and durability. They represent the combination of their will to keep going, and their sturdiness of mind and body. As one would expect, the more Hit Points you have, the harder you are to put in the ground. The less you have, the easier it is.</p><p>A creature or character&rsquo;s current Hit Points, as in the health that they still retain in that moment (normally just referred to as Hit Points), can be anywhere in the range of 0 to their maximum number of Hit Points.</p><p>Hit Points tend to change in number frequently due to being attacked and healed. When you take damage, you subtract that number from your current Hit Points; when you receive healing, you add that number instead. Creatures and characters can continue fighting uninhibited by this number, and functioning normally, until it hits zero.</p><p></p><p>Damage Rolls</p><p>Every spell, harmful ability, and weapon specifies the dice used to calculate its damage. So when using a weapon to attack you roll the specified die, add any relevant modifiers, and then apply the total as the damage to the target. When attacking with a spell, it will tell you which die to roll for damage and what, if any, bonuses to apply. Should your spell damage more than one person, you roll your dice once for each of them. Unless your spell hits more than one target at once, at which point you roll damage once for all of them.</p><p>In the case of weapon attacks, you add your Strength modifier for melee weapons, and your Dexterity modifier for ranged weapons, to attack and damage rolls. However, thrown and finesse weapons break this rule.</p><p></p><p><strong>Damage Dice Size Increase</strong></p><p>In <em>Undertaking</em>, there can be several things that affect your damage dice. There may be time that a situation calls for you to increase or decrease the damage dice by a step, or that they are one step larger or smaller. In cases such as that, refer to the following chart:</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em>Steps in Damage Size Table</em></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Damage Dice</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1d4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1d8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2d4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1d10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1d12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2d8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2d10</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Should you have an ability that has you increase your damage by a step, simply find the damage your attack currently does, and move to the next largest on the table. Or, should it decrease by a step, find the next smallest.</p><p>For example, if you have an attack that does 1d6 damage, and it increases by one step, or becomes one step larger, it would go to a 1d8. Similarly, if it decreased by a step, it would go to a 1d4.</p><p></p><p><strong>Critical Hits</strong></p><p>Whenever a critical hit is rolled, you get to roll extra dice for that attack&rsquo;s damage against the target you rolled to hit. To do this, you roll twice the amount of attack dice specified for dealing damage in the attack. Once you have the resulting number, you add modifiers and bonuses that apply as normal.</p><p>The doubling of damage dice includes all dice being rolled to deal damage to the target, such as the damage added by a Rogue&rsquo;s Sneak Attack.</p><p></p><p><strong>Damage Types</strong></p><p>All harmful effects in <em>Undertaking</em>, such as weapon attacks, spells, etc, have a damage type, and they can vary widely. While the types themselves don&rsquo;t have rules, there are others that rely on them (like resistance and vulnerability).</p><p>These damage types are as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li><em>Acid:</em> The corrosive and dissolving power of a caustic substance that is either man made or a natural defense for some creatures</li><li><em>Bludgeoning:</em> Blunt force trauma that deals with crushing in some way</li><li><em>Cold:</em> A chill so frigid that it begins to freeze the target alive</li><li><em>Fire:</em> The scorching blaze of excessive heat that causes terrible burns</li><li><em>Force:</em> Damage dealt by pure magical energy effects and concussive waves</li><li><em>Lightning:</em> Electricity of such voltage that it causes physical damage</li><li><em>Necrotic:</em> The power of the grave that withers matter and the soul</li><li><em>Piercing:</em> Puncturing and impaling effects aimed at leaving holes in the target</li><li><em>Poison:</em> The creeping venomous damage that corrupts the body and curdles the blood</li><li><em>Psychic:</em> The oppressive strikes against a psyche that causes pain akin to a magnified migraine</li><li><em>Radiant:</em> A power that burn like fire and strikes the soul, causing both physical and spiritual damage</li><li><em>Slashing:</em> The cutting and tearing of flesh and hide alike, through bladed instruments, both man-made and natural</li><li><em>Sonic:</em> Large bursts of sound that rattle the bones, and can rupture eardrums and organs alike</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Attribute Damage</strong></p><p>If you have taken damage to one or more attributes, every long rest you can restore one attribute by 1 up to its previous amount.</p><p>If any one ability reaches 0, you die.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Resistance/Vulnerability</strong></p><p>There exist creatures in <em>Undertaking</em> that are going to be exceedingly difficult to kill with particular types of damage, and others that will be easy to destroy with particular types of damage. This is referred to as damage resistance and damage vulnerability, respectively.</p><p>A monster, object, or player that has resistance against a type of damage will only take half damage from any attack using it. Whereas, something or someone with vulnerability to a particular type of damage will take double damage from it.</p><p>It should also be noted that both resistance and vulnerability are calculated after all other modifiers and bonuses have taken effect. Meaning that if there is another effect that dampens damage, that one comes into effect first before resistance or vulnerability would.</p><p>For example, should a monster take 40 points of damage, but have both a resistance to it and an ability that reduces that number by 10, it would take 15 damage. The 10 damage would be taken off first, making it 30 damage, and then halved to 15 by resistance.</p><p>As well, if a creature or player has more than one resistance, and they both come into effect for a particular attack, the damage is still only reduced by half, not three quarters.</p><p>For example, if there is a character that has resistance to both magical damage and cold damage, and gets struck by the spell <em>Winter&rsquo;s Piercing Ray, </em>the spell&rsquo;s damage is still only halved.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Healing</p><p>Damage done to a creature or player isn&rsquo;t permanent unless it results in their death, and even then it is possible to solve that through powerful magic spells like <em>Revivify.</em></p><p>Rest can restore a character&rsquo;s health, (see <strong>&ldquo;Chapter 6: How to Play&rdquo; </strong>for more on resting) as can magic, like any kind of <em>Treat Wound </em>spell or magic items such as certain potions. And magical effects can do it instantaneously, instead of needing a period of time like resting.</p><p>As explained earlier under Hit Points, when a creature or character receives healing, the hit points regained are added to their current hit point value. Healing cannot have the character exceed their maximum, however.</p><p>For example, if a healing spell is cast on a characters with 23 current hit points out of a maximum of 34, and they are healed for 15, the spell would heal them for 11 and take them to their max of 34. Not boost them to 38 hit points.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</p><p>If and when a character is dropped to 0 hit points, they either die instantly or go unconscious. As described by the following conditions and rules:</p><p></p><p><strong>Instant Death</strong></p><p>It is possible to die instantly from taking massive amounts of damage at one time. Any time a character is dropped to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining from the attack, should that number take you to a negative number equal to or exceeding your maximum hit points, you die.</p><p>For example, say Lana the barbarian is at 6 health points left of 24. If she were to take an attack that dealt her 30 damage at that point in time, she would drop to 0, and there would be 24 points of damage remaining. Since the remaining damage is equal to her maximum health, Lana would die.</p><p></p><p><strong>Unconscious</strong><em></em></p><p>If damage reduces a character to 0 hit points, but does not instantly kill them, then they are rendered unconscious and will continue to be so until they regain any hit points. For details on the condition of being unconscious, check the section for <strong>Unconscious </strong>under <strong>Conditions.</strong></p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Death Throws</p><p>Should a character start their turn with 0 hit points, they are forced to make a special roll known as a <strong>Death Throw</strong>. The character&rsquo;s survival depends on the result of these throws, ending with them either clinging to life, or falling into death&rsquo;s icy grip.</p><p>To make a death throw, roll a flat D20. If the result is 11 or higher, that&rsquo;s a success. Anything else is a failure. Mark it down and continue making one death throw at the start of your turn while at 0 hit point until you either have three successes or three failures. Upon three successes, you become <strong>Stable</strong>. Upon three failures, your character dies.</p><p>The number of successful and failed death throws are reset if you either regain hit points or become Stable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rolling a 1 or 20</strong></p><p>Should you roll a natural 1 on a death throw&rsquo;s D20, it results in 2 failures. Should you roll a natural 20 instead, it results in immediately regaining 1 hit point.</p><p></p><p><strong>Taking Damage at 0 Hit Points</strong></p><p>If a character takes any damage at 0 hit points, that counts as an automatic failed death throw. Should that damage be from a critical hit, it instead counts as 2 failed death throws. If the damage dealt exceeds the character&rsquo;s maximum hit points then the character instantly dies.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stabilizing</strong></p><p>The best way to keep a creature from dying is to heal it. However, that option is not always available, and in its absence another character can do the next best thing: stabilize the dying creature.</p><p>A creature can use their action to attempt to administer first aid on a dying creature to stabilize them. With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, they become <strong>Stable</strong>.</p><p>Find <strong>Stable</strong> in the &ldquo;Conditions&rdquo; section later in this chapter for more details.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>The Death of Monsters</strong></p><p>Generally, most GMs have monsters die at 0 hit points rather than have them make death throws. However, they might make exceptions for powerful foes or special NPCs.</p><p></p><p><em>Knocking a creature out:</em> Certain creatures or players may want to incapacitate a foe rather than kill it outright. Should that be the case, when a creature makes an attack against a foe and drops them to 0 hit points, then after the damage is dealt they can immediately say they want to knock the foe out rather than kill it.</p><p>This results in the target falling unconscious instead, and is considered Stable.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Temporary Hit Points</p><p>There are spells and abilities in <em>Undertaking</em> that impart temporary Hit Points on characters and creatures. These are special Hit Points, used as a buffer against harm rather than adding vitality. These work as a pool of Hit Points that deplete first, and keep a character from being truly harmed.</p><p>When a character has temporary Hit Points, they are lost first and then any damage left over effects their actual current Hit Points. For example, should Lana have 12 temporary Hit Points, and then takes 15 damage, she would subtract from her pool of temporary Hit Points first, and then the remaining 3 damage would be deducted from her current Hit Points.</p><p>Being that temporary Hit Points are a seperate pool of vitality from your actual Hit Points, this number can exceed your maximum Hit Points. Which means that even if you are at full health you can still get the benefit from temporary Hit Points.</p><p>However, healing cannot restore any temporary Hit Points that you may have, and they do not stack on top of one another. Since they are treated as separate pools of health, should you receive temporary Hit Points on top of some that you already have, you have to decide which pool to keep.</p><p>Say Lana already has 7 temporary Hit Points, but one of her party casts a spell that gives her 12 temporary Hit Points. She would then have to decide whether she wants the 7 or 12, not add them together to 19.</p><p>As well, temporary Hit Points cannot return you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still take damage for you while your character is in such a state, but only healing can save you. And unless there is a duration stated in the effect that gave you temporary Hit Points, they last until either they are taken up by damage or your character takes a long rest. </p><h2>Conditions</h2><p>Bleeding</p><ul><li>Bleeding creatures take 1 damage each round at the beginning of their turn.</li><li>Unless otherwise stated, you can cure all current bleed damage by making a DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) check as an action, when your Hit Points reach 0, or you receive magical healing.</li><li>Can be stacked up to 5 damage each round.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Blinded</p><ul><li>Blinded creatures cannot see, and fail any checks that require sight.</li><li>Attack rolls against blinded creatures have advantage.</li><li>See rules for &lsquo;Attacking a Unseen Target&rsquo; earlier in this chapter when a blinded creature makes an attack</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Charmed</p><ul><li>Charmed creatures cannot attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or spells.</li><li>The charmer has advantage on social skill checks with the charmed creature.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Deafened</p><ul><li>Deafened creatures cannot hear, and fail skill checks that require hearing.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Diseased</p><ul><li>Diseases are numerous, and their effects vary.</li><li>Creatures can contract more than one disease as long as each disease is different.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Exhausted</p><ul><li>Exhaustion comes in levels, with each level keeping the detriments of the previous level.</li><li>A <strong>long rest</strong> with food and drink reduces a creature&rsquo;s exhaustion by 1 level.</li><li>Consequently, skipping a <strong>long rest</strong> can cause exhaustion to worsen.</li><li>When a creature&rsquo;s exhaustion level decreases to 0, the condition is removed.</li><li>Level 1: Disadvantage on Skill Checks</li><li>Level 2: Speed halved</li><li>Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and save checks</li><li>Level 4: Hit point maximum halved</li><li>Level 5: Speed reduced to 0</li><li>Level 6: Incapacitated</li><li>Level 7: Death</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Frightened</p><ul><li>Frightened creatures have disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls while the source of fear is within line of sight.</li><li>Frightened creatures cannot willingly move closer to the source of their fear.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Grappled</p><ul><li>Grappled creatures have a speed of 0, and cannot benefit from bonuses to speed.</li><li>The condition ends if the grappler releases the target, is incapacitated, or is removed from the reach of the target.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Incapacitated</p><ul><li>Incapacitated creatures cannot take Actions, Minor Actions, Desperate Actions, or Reactions.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Paralyzed</p><ul><li>Paralyzed creatures are <strong>incapacitated</strong> and cannot move or speak.</li><li>The creature automatically fails Strength (Save) and Dexterity (Save) checks.</li><li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li><li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5ft of the creature.</li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Petrified</p><ul><li>A petrified creature, and any non-magical objects that it is carrying or wearing, is transformed into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone).
