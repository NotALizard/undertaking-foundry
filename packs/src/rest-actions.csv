Magical properties can even manifest physical ways, such as a feeling of connection or dread while holding it.</p><p>Wearing or experimenting with a magic item can be a useful way of figuring out what a magic item is capable of, so long as the item does not require attunement, though this method can take a good bit longer. If a character is unable to determine if an item is magical, they can still attempt to attune to it. However, they do not know if they successfully attuned, and are not given any information on what the item does or the effects it has without further experimentation or full identification.</p><p>However, many magical items are indistinguishable from non-magical items. If the item is suspected of being a magic item, the creature can attempt to identify it.</p><p>The fastest way to figure out how a magic item works is through casting <em>Identify. </em>However, a character can attempt to identify the magical properties of one item as a <strong>long rest action</strong>.
