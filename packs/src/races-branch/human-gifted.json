Be it through genes, luck, or divine intervention, gifted humans are a cut above the common folk, and are often picked on for this.  However, as with most gifts, those who rely upon their natural talent are quickly surpassed by those who work hard.  Gifted humans who really work at it, though, are capable of almost anything.</p>",
