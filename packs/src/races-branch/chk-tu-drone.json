      "value": "<p>Born with an extra set of arms, drones are especially skilled with their hands.  Their hand-eye coordination and nearly doubled arm strength makes them exceptional builders, workers, and tenders.  Meanwhile, their four-armed approach to fighting makes them a force to reckoned with in battle.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, drones are born with stunted, useless wings if any at all, leaving them without any form of vertical movement.  This makes spotting a drone chk'tu far from its home or hive unlikely.</p>",
