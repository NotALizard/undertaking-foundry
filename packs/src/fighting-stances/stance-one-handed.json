      "value": "<p><i>Requirement:</i> A single one-handed melee weapon without the Heavy, Special, or Unarmed traits.</p><hr><p>Holding your off-hand close to the torso, you turn your body to the side to make your body less of a target to opponents.  Staying light on your feet to make up for your lack of defense, you place your weapon out front, ready to fend off any attacker.</p><hr><u>Pros</u><p><b>Minor Multi-attack</b><ul><li>When you make an attack action, you can attack again as a minor action.</li></ul><b>Deflect</b><ul><li>If an opponent that you can see misses you with a melee attack, you can immediately move 5ft without evoking an opportunity attack from your attacker as a non-action.</li></ul><b>Critical Stagger</b><ul><li>When you land a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution (Save) check of DC 10 + your Attack Modifier or be moved back one spot in initiative.</li></ul></p><hr><u>Cons</u><p><b>Traitless</b><ul><li>If your weapon has traits, it acts as if it has none.  This does not remove the Finesse trait.</li></ul><b>Imprecision</b><ul><li>If you have disadvantage on an attack, roll a 1d6 and subtract it from your final damage, minimum of 0.</li></ul></p>",
