You raise your weapon in your front arm and balance with your other, bending your knees slightly for more stability and to better jab, parry, and riposte your opponent.</p><hr><u>Pros</u><p><b>Parry</b><ul><li>As a minor action, you cause a single target to have disadvantage attacking you until the beginning of your next turn as long as you can see the target.</li></ul><b>Riposte</b><ul><li>As a reaction, you can make an opportunity attack against a creature you see that misses you with an attack while you are either in Self-Defense or are Parrying the target.</li></ul></p><hr><u>Cons</u><p><b>Trained For Vitals</b><ul><li>You have disadvantage on attacks against constructs and creatures wearing Heavy Armor.</li></ul><b>Uneven Circumstances</b><ul><li>Natural weapon attacks from creatures larger than you, heavy weapons, and spell attacks are unaffected by Self-Defense, Parry, or bonuses granted by desperate actions when attacking you, and the attacker cannot be targeted for a Riposte.</li></ul></p>",
