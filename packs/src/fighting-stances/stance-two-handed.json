You widen your stance to support full-body swings, tightening your grip in anticipation.</p><hr><u>Pros</u><p><b>Cleave</b><ul><li>Once per turn, during your attack action, you can target two creatures with a single attack so long as they are both:<ul><li>Within reach of you.</li><li>Within 10ft of each other.</li></ul></li></ul><b>Called Shot</b><ul><li>You take an action to prepare a strike, ending your turn.  At the beginning of your next turn, you can choose to attack a target within range.  This attack takes up an action, but automatically hits and is a critical hit.  You can take a desperate action to trigger the called shot critical hit early, but you gain a level of @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.ERBR3AG01H4N1L91]{Exhaustion} and cannot take a desperate action until after your next full turn.  If you otherwise take an action or a desperate action before this, your strike is no longer prepared.</li></ul><b>Fulcrum-Free</b><ul><li>You can make attacks with two-handed weapons using one hand, but the attack is made at disadvantage.</li></ul></p><hr><u>Cons</u><p><b>Full Swing</b><ul><li>Attack actions take up both your action and minor action.</li></ul><b>Grasp-Free</b><ul><li>If you roll a critical fail on a Fulcrum-Free attack, you drop your weapon and exit this stance.</li></ul></p>",
