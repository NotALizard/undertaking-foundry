            "value": "<p>Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue them with the ability to release magical energies from their mouth as a mighty dragon would; provided they have a mouth to begin with.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison as the damage type for the breath, and until the spell ends, all damage dealt from this spell is that type.  While the spell is active, the creature can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15 foot cone.  Anyone caught inside it must make a Dexterity (Save) check.  If they fail, they take 3d6 points of damage from the chosen type.  On a success, they take half damage.  <br><br>The spell DC for Dragon\u2019s Breath is the spell DC of the caster.  <br><br>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, increasing the damage done with this spell.  Costs and increase are as follow: <ul><li>4 Mana: Increase damage by 1d6 of chosen type</li><li>8 Mana: Increase damage by 2d6 by chosen type</li></ul></p>",
