            "value": "<p>Designating one creature within the spell\u2019s range that you can see, you gather the force of gravity and bring it crashing down on the target.  The target must make a Dexterity (Save) check.  On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 force damage and its base speed is reduced to 0 feet.  On a success, the creature only takes half damage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the target fail its save check, the spell continues and the caster must keep up concentration.  While the spell is ongoing, the target retains a speed of 0 feet, however, it does not take damage again.  The target gets a chance to make another Dexterity (Save) check at the end of each of their turns to break free.</p>",
