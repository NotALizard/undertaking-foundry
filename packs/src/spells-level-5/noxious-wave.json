Each creature that you choose, that is hit by the cloud, must make a Constitution (Save) check.  On a failed (Save) check, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage, as well as 3d6 necrotic damage, and is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened}.  On a success the creature takes half damage and is not @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened}.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas cloud stays active up to 1 minute if the caster concentrates to keep it going, but stays stationary.  Creatures that pass through the cloud, or end their turn within it, must make a Constitution (Save) check.  On a success, nothing happens and they pass through it without harm.  On a failure, creatures suffer 2d6 poison damage and 1d6 necrotic damage.  Additionally, should a creature that was @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} fail a Constitution (Save) check against this effect, they become @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.SRRBLPRSJWGUR551]{Poisoned}.</p>",
