When you do, you lose access to the traits of your previous @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.726QUN63DM3JKKPN]{Gladiatorial Role} and may choose another one. If you change @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.726QUN63DM3JKKPN]{Gladiatorial Role} within 1 month of the last change, then you can only gain half heat for 1 week following.</p>",
