So long as you have relevant materials equal to &frac34; of the armor&rsquo;s cost, you can work on creating the item over the course of multiple rests. Each <em>Rest Action </em>you spend working on it, make an Intelligence (Craft) check against DC 10. Each success counts as 1 completed work session, a failure does not. Depending on the item&rsquo;s actual cost, it takes more work sessions to complete (see @Compendium[undertaking.tables.WS5UX4KFBB0PAZAE]{Craft Artisanal} table).</p>",
