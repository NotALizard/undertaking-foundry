The first rest you spend creating the work of art, make an Intelligence (Craft) check. The result of the check is its initial @Compendium[undertaking.tables.SVAINSJV86RZ4629]{Art Quality} level, which determines the base selling price of the art piece. The initial creation of an art piece takes up 5gp worth of supplies.</p><ul><li>You can attempt to make an art piece with less than 5gp worth of supplies for a -1 to your Intelligence (Craft) checks, and a further -1 for each 5sp less than 5gp, to a minimum of 1gp. For example, using supplies worth a bit more than 2gp will confer a -6 on your Intelligence (Craft) check.</li></ul>",
