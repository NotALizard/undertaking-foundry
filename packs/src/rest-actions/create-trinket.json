So long as you have relevant materials equal to &frac34; of the trinket&rsquo;s cost, you can work on creating the item over the course of short or long rests. Each <em>Rest Action</em> you spend working on it, make an Intelligence (Craft) check against DC 10. Each success counts as 1 completed work session; a failure does not. Depending on the item&rsquo;s actual cost, it takes more work sessions to complete.</p><p>See&nbsp;@Compendium[undertaking.tables.OANH1Q51JDEB8ETI]{Tinkercraft} table.</p>",
