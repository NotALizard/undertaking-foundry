            "value": "<p>As a <em>Rest Action</em>, you can put on a performance to get your mind off of things. When you do, choose to either add a +1 to all skill checks made during this rest (aside from this one) or, before your next rest, add a +1 to a single check&rsquo;s final result. <br />In addition, make a Presence (Perform) check. Take the result divided by 5 and rounded down. Choose that many other creatures resting nearby to gain the same choice of entertainment bonus. <br />Should you roll a Natural 20 on, all creatures gain both bonuses. In addition, choose one member of the rest, other than yourself, to gain a point of Luck.</p>",
