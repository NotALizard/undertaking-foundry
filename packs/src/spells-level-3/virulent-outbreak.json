On a failed save, a creature takes 6d4 poison damage and becomes temporarily infected with the chosen @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9YPWLY1IHQV3MRLO]{Disease}.  On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not infected.  An infected creature can repeat the save check at the end of each of its turns, ending the disease on a success.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the creature fails its Constitution (Save) check 5 times, they stop making the save, and the @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9YPWLY1IHQV3MRLO]{Disease} remains indefinitely.</p>",
