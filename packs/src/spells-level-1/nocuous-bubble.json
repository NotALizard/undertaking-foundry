Make a ranged spell attack against the target, dealing 2d8 poison damage on a hit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit or miss, the bubble bursts and disperses noxious gas. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution (Save) check or become @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} until the end of your next turn.  <br><br>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow: <ul><li>1 Mana: The radius of the noxious gas increases to 10 feet. </li><li>1 Mana: Creatures that fail the Constitution (Save) check to avoid becoming @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} also take 1d8 poison damage. </li></ul></p>",
