For as long as this spell is active, the target is treated as if they have proficiency in unarmed strikes, and the damage of their unarmed strikes increase.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their damage was a base of 1, it is now 1d4.  If the damage for their unarmed strikes is already a die (such as 1d4, 1d8, etc) then that damage is one step larger.  (Refer to the 'Steps in Damage Size Table' in \"Chapter 6: How to Play\")</p>",
