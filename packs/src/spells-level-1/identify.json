If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them.  As well as whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any.  You also learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are.  If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell was used to create it.</p><p>Should you touch a creature instead throughout this casting, you learn what spells, if any, that are currently affecting it.</p>",
