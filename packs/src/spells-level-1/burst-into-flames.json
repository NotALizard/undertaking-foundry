On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and must make a Dexterity (Save) check.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a fail, the target is now on fire and must make a Dexterity (Save) check at the start of each of their turns to put it out.  Every time they fail, the target takes 1d6 points of fire damage.  A successful save avoids being set on fire.<br><br>Charge: This spell can be Charged, increasing the spell\u2019s damage.  Costs and increase are as follow: <ul><li>3 Mana: Initial damage increases by 1d6</li><li>7 Mana: Initial damage increases by 2d6, and damage taken from being on fire increases by 1d6</li></ul></p>",
