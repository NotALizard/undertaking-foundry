On a failed save, they take 3d6 fire damage and are set on fire. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not set on fire.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a creature is on fire from this spell, they suffer 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns and shed 5ft of bright light plus an additional 5ft of dim light. At the end of each of the creature\u2019s turns they can repeat their save, putting the fire out on a success. A burning creature can also be extinguished by being submerged in a liquid, or if any creature within reach uses their action to put the fire out.<br><br>Charge: This spell can be Charged, modifying the spell\u2019s damage.  Costs and effects are as follow: <ul><li>2 Mana: While the target of the spell is on fire, Creatures that end their turn within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity (Save) check. On a failed save, that creature is also set on fire.</li><li>2 Mana: The initial fire damage increases to 5d6.</li></ul></p>",
