On hit, the target takes 6d10 piercing damage.  In either case the shard explodes, causing all creatures within 10 feet of the initial target to make a Dexterity (Save) check.  On failure, that creature takes 4d6 piercing damage, or half as much on a success. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of your next turn all creatures injured or affected by this spell must make a Constitution (Save) check as the crystalline shards that hit them shatter in a sonic blast.  On a failure, a target takes 5d6 force damage, but takes half as much damage on a success.</p>",
