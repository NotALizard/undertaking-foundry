Such spells can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell will have no effect on them.  As well, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas of affect from spells of these levels.<br><br>Charge: This spell can be Charged to provide better protection:<ul><li>2 Mana: Spells of up to 6th level cannot penetrate the barrier.</li></ul></p>",
