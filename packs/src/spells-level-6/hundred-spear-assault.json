Creatures caught in the line must make a Dexterity (Save) check.  On failure, they take 7d6 piercing damage and 4d6 force damage, and have their speed reduced to 0 feet until the end of their next turn as the piercing spears hold targets in place.  On success, they take half damage and do not have their speed reduced.</p>",
