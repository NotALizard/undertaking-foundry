All sleeping creatures that hear it are awoken, and up to 5 allied creatures of your choice that hear it gain temporary hit points equal to 5 or your level, whichever is higher.  Temporary hit points gained this way can be stacked.  You can use this racial ability once per long or short rest.</p>",
