Use the un-reduced mana cost when checking if it satisfies the limit for how much mana you can spend on a single spell.</p><p>In addition, when a creature triggers an attack of opportunity from you, you can use your reaction to cast a cantrip at the creature instead of making an opportunity attack. The cantrip must have a casting time of 1 action or less and must only target that creature.</p>",
