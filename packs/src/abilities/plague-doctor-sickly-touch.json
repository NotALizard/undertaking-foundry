      "value": "<p>When making a melee spell or weapon attack against a single target, you can choose to turn the attack sickly.  Should the sickly attack hit, the target becomes @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened}.  A creature affected by this ability can make a Constitution (Save) check at the end of each of their turns against your Spell Save DC to cure themselves of the @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} condition.<br>A creature that has been @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} by this ability and fails its Constitution (Save) check three times in a row, contracts <i>Plague Doctor&rsquo;s Disease</i>.<br>This ability affects the target until it has either saved, or 2 minutes have passed. Whichever comes first.<br>You can only use this ability a number of times equal to 2 + half your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) before needing a long rest to be able to use it again. A long rest gives you back all your uses of this ability.</p><p><i>Plague Doctor&rsquo;s Disease: </i>A creature afflicted with this disease acts as if it has the @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.SRRBLPRSJWGUR551]{Poisoned} condition until cured. However, the creature is considered @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9YPWLY1IHQV3MRLO]{Diseased} for the purposes of being cured, not @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.SRRBLPRSJWGUR551]{Poisoned}.</p>",
