      "value": "<p>Through experimentation, practice, and maybe some help from a teacher, you have learned new forms of battle. Fighting Stances are methods of combat that grant the user pros and cons, but only while in use. Pick 2 Fighting Stances from the &ldquo;Stance List&rdquo; later in this section.</p><p><em>Usage:</em> Unless stated otherwise, you can change your Fighting Stance as a minor action or at the end of an attack action, so long as you are not @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.RK3DF56CKMQUV6DM]{Prone}. You remain in your current Fighting Stance until your weapon is dropped, sheathed, or otherwise removed from your possession, you become @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.RK3DF56CKMQUV6DM]{Prone}, @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.PEDR1J13VZXKUF3C]{Stunned}, or @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9KB959MRZ0H4IT4C]{Unconscious}, or until you end your stance as a minor action. <br /> If a stance requires a weapon with a certain trait, all weapons currently wielded must also have that trait, with the exception of shields and natural weapons. Unless the stance says otherwise, shields <em>can</em> be held in an available hand while in a fighting stance. Attacking with a natural weapon that does not meet the requirements of your current Fighting Stance causes you to end your stance before the attack.</p><p><em>Learning New Stances:</em> You learn 2 extra stances at each Growth Level.<br /> Many Fighter Sub-Classes have expanded Fighting Stance options. Once the unlock requirements for Fighting Stances from that Sub-Class have been met, you are able to choose Fighting Stances from that list when learning new stances as part of level up.</p><br><br><u><i>Stance List</i></u><br>@Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.AQKR36ORJ8UW7M7O]{Ammunition Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.U0YH0GDRUF7KZ3HP]{Boxing Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.59STQWZ34C00OVZP]{Finesse Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.4RWGBRI6CNCPMKCG]{Heavy Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.QEDI2ZY7AFB0GFXY]{Light Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.7ECXODBQJAZNTQFS]{Loading Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.TO8A2T5QL9GR8MAF]{One-Handed Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.98PGZKRSGDG2L2L7]{Quick-Draw Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.SK2FZU8XH2UZX0GP]{Ranged Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.H2554TR82JFKPYS2]{Reach Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.5TS3VRP8JKUPXU0Z]{Shield Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.4IQUGM1GK28XR39P]{Slugger Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.XK4PEQX6RYXIKTZ6]{Throwing Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.CAIFAC3V8NQRCZUQ]{Two-Handed Stance}, @Compendium[undertaking.fighting-stances.OV4KEWGS7DFIDZ0Q]{Versatile Stance}",
