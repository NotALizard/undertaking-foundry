      "value": "<p>You have a stinger on your abdomen that is bred to kill. If you attempt to sting a creature with it, make a melee weapon attack with proficiency. On hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage, and you take 1d10 chaos damage as the stinger rips out. On a critical hit, the target becomes @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.SRRBLPRSJWGUR551]{Poisoned}. Otherwise the target must make a Constitution (Save) Check of DC 10 + your proficiency bonus. On failure, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage and is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} until the end of your next turn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot use this racial trait again until you take a <em>Long Rest Action</em> to focus your body on regrowing the stinger.</p>",
