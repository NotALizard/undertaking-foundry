      "value": "<p>A thief&rsquo;s hands are trained in delicate procedures, a natural quickness that allows for sneaky operations. As thieves act throughout the day, their mental and physical acuity is drained, until they inevitably botch an attempt. Thieves sometimes call these &ldquo;Thief Fingers&rdquo; or simply Fingers (with a capital F), referring to how many more tricks the thief can pull off before failing.</p><p>You have 5 &ldquo;Fingers&rdquo; (regardless of how many <em>fingers</em> you have) which represent the deftness of your most thieving faculties. They can be spent to take certain Thief actions.</p><p>Fingers are regained at the end of a rest.</p>",
