These limbs are considered natural weapons equivalent to shortswords.  You are proficient with these blades, and can use them as if dual-wielding.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not gain extra attacks, actions or minor actions with these limbs.  Additionally, while wearing any armor, shields only grant bonuses when held in 2 hands due to limited mobility.</p>",
