In addition, the Wizard can store this focus in a pocket dimension when it is unneeded, and summon it from this space as a non-action.  Only the focus can be stored like this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the focus is ever taken from the Wizard, they can create a bond with another item through a ritual taking a long rest to do so.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arcane bond cannot be bestowed upon a creature, an enchanted object, and can be no bigger than 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot.</p>",
