You can touch a single target and either remove the @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.R54LQEKSDXNQ3N75]{Bleeding} or @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened} condition, or reduce the @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9YPWLY1IHQV3MRLO]{Diseased} condition to @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9X088PM7H5U2S1HQ]{Sickened}.  In addition, this ability bestows a number of temporary Hit Points to the target equal to your Wizard level + your Intelligence Modifier.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only use this ability a number of times equal to 2 + half your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) before needing a long rest to be able to use it again.  A long rest gives you back all your uses of this ability.</p>",
