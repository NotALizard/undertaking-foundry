You can use your action to remove the seal from or magically affix it to a necklace chain, shield, or weapon you are holding. While the seal is somewhere on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to the save DCs of your Cleric spells, as well as to the total result of Faith Die rolls made to deal damage or gain temporary hit points.</p><p>Before attacking with any weapon, you can choose to increase the size of the weapon&rsquo;s damage die any number of steps (to a maximum size of 1d12). On a hit, the damage roll suffers a -1 penalty for each step you chose to increase the damage die (minimum 0 damage).</p>",
