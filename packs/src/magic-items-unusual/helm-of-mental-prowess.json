Additionally, the helm has 5 charges, and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. These charges can be used to cast either @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-5.LE5BM8DCSZCPUGMV]{Telekinetic Might} or @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-5.J9QLMOBH6NXLN5OQ]{Telepathic Network} by expending 1 charge for either.</p><p>Alternatively, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-5.J9QLMOBH6NXLN5OQ]{Telepathic Network} can be cast with 2 charges, which allows it to be maintained even if @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-5.LE5BM8DCSZCPUGMV]{Telekinetic Might} is also cast with the helm, effectively allowing both to be active at one time.</p>",
