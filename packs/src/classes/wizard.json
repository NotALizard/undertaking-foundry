      "value": "<p>Magic, one of life's greatest puzzles, has long drawn the eyes of many. It can bend, shift, and even break the laws of reality itself, or at least the laws as we know them. However, this, as with any science, requires intense knowledge of the world and how to manipulate it. Either that, or a whole lot of practice. In either case, Wizards are these spellcasters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether seeking power, knowledge, or even a way to defy death, Wizards are those who have committed to understanding the mystical sciences of spellcasting. Always experimenting and learning, Wizards are perpetually locked in the pursuit of knowledge that might further their capabilities in the magics that truly make up this world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within adventuring parties, Wizards wield arcane focuses to cast spells, and are typically known for providing powerful backline assistance. Unlike other spellcasters, Wizards have the widest array of spells at their fingertips. From devastating destruction spells to powerful barriers, Wizards are the swiss army knife of the arcane. Even in melee, while Wizards traditionally do not care to be caught in the fray, they can specialize in magicks that can make even martial foes quake.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Quick Build</h3><p>If you are looking to play a Wizard as quickly as possible, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Intelligence should be one of your highest Attributes.</li><li>Either Constitution or Dexterity should be one of your next highest Attributes.</li><ul><li>If you are planning to use spells from the School of Enchantment often, make Presence your second highest Attribute instead.</li></ul><li>Choose @Compendium[undertaking.spells-cantrips.AH9WKC83KALKQQ19]{Elemental Cloak}, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-cantrips.IJ97BYFB2ANTKOSW]{Force of Will}, and @Compendium[undertaking.spells-cantrips.NTGJ71IJ1VDA3GS9]{Luminescence} as your Cantrips for variety.</li><li>Choose @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.7N5KBCOM40ZX65EO]{Arcane Arrows}, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.N4PE33ACTOXHF3FJ]{Biting Wind}, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.LO6PLV28RA6CBCLU]{Burst Into Flames}, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.NI3IWI89HKX1VH6R]{Conjure Fundamental}, @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.5F78LN7YILWPNJL2]{Ethereal Mail}, and @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-1.N3BHT4QNPIDGVC6C]{Nocuous Bubble} as your 1st level spells.</li></ul>",

For example, if you start at level 5 and put all of your levels in Wizard, you do not automatically get ten level 3 spells.  You can only take two 3rd level spells in this example, because you only meet the requirements for your 5th level in Wizard, but not your 4th, 3rd, and so on.</p><h4><b>New Ability (Skip for Growth Levels)</b></h4><p>Each time you gain a Wizard level, unless it is a Growth Level, gain one ability of your choice from the following list or from any Wizard Sub-Class.

If an ability has requirements listed with it then you must satisfy all of them before you can choose that ability.
