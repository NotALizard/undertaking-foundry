A creature caught in the line must make a Constitution (Save) check.  On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 cold damage and has its speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.  The damage is halved on a successful save, and their speed isn\u2019t affected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any space this line passes over is covered in snow and considered difficult terrain for the next 1 minute after casting.</p>",
