If the spell does not end before 1 minute, the spell does not reverse when it ends, leaving the creature in its home plane.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the target is native to the plane that it is currently in, it is instead banished to a harmless pocket plane.  While there, the target is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.3CQC3JEY2C3Y721F]{Incapacitated}, and remains there until the spell ends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spell ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.  <br><br>Charge: This spell can be Charged to target more creatures.  <ul><li>2 Mana: 1 extra creature.</li><li>4 Mana: 2 extra creatures.</li><li>6 Mana: 3 extra creatures.</li><li>11 Mana: 4 extra creatures.</li><li>16 Mana: 5 extra creatures.</li></ul></p>",
