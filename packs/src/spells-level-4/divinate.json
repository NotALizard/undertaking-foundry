            "value": "<p>By placing an offering and praying for a response, you become placed in contact with a deity or a deity\u2019s servant.  You ask a single question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days.  The GM offers a truthful reply.  The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cast this spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, your GM rolls a 1d4.  Depending on how many times the spell has been cast, the chance of it failing goes up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell returns a random reading on a roll of 1 on the 2nd casting, 1 or 2 on the 3rd casting, 1-3 on the 4th casting, and automatically returns a random reading on the 5th+ casting.</p>",
