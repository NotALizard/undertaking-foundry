            "value": "<p>Each Pathfinding Kit includes the following equipment piece:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Gripped Shoes:</strong></strong> While worn on all feet, you have advantage against tripping or slipping due to the environment.</li></ul><p>With Pathfinding Trade Proficiency, you can do the following:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Star Reading:</strong></strong> So long as you can see the unobstructed sky at night, you always know what direction you are pointing, as well as the general hemisphere and season. You also have +2 on checks to determine your location on a map.</li><li><strong>Locate Self:</strong> You have a +2 on checks to determine your location on a map, or to determine what an unlabeled or mislabeled map is a map of, if you would know the place.</li><li><strong>Track Creature:</strong> You have expertise on Wisdom (Instinct) checks to track a creature through an environment you&rsquo;ve mapped before.</li></ul><p>If you have Pathfinding Trade Proficiency, you can use the Pathfinding Kit in the following ways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Surveyor:</strong></strong> While travelling long-distance, each time the party travels into adjacent terrain (often represented by a 3-mile hex) and after revealing adjacent terrain via line of sight, you can use the &ldquo;Survey Surroundings&rdquo; Travel Option at no time cost. You cannot use this option while travelling at a fast pace.</li><li><strong>Explore Area:</strong> As a <em>Rest Action</em>, you can explore the 3-mile terrain you were in when you started this rest. Doing so allows you to do one of the following&mdash;two, if using a <em>Long Rest Action</em>:<ul><li><em>Recon</em>: Learn if the area openly contains a certain creature type or species, a type of structure or ruin, a type of business or service, the presence of a certain group or power, the availability of an item or equipment for trade, or the ready availability of food or water.</li><li><em>Track</em>: Select a specific creature you know to have been in the environment within the past week and make a Wisdom (Investigation) check to try and determine the creature&rsquo;s direction. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you also find a clue about the creature, such as if it&rsquo;s injured, if it&rsquo;s been here often, if it&rsquo;s dropped a clue, etc.</li><li><em>Gossip</em>: While resting in a settlement, learn of a local rumor or relevant job posting.</li><li><em>Scout</em>: Reveal an inconspicuous aspect of the surrounding environment or culture as determined by the DM. You can&rsquo;t direct what you&rsquo;ll find, but you&rsquo;ll always find something, even if just a few extra coins. For example, a hidden dungeon entrance, a back entrance to a notable structure, a hidden or lost treasure, a creature or group notable or unique to the area, a local creature nest, a surprising food or water source, a cultural practice or expectation you had yet to learn, an event in motion, or simply an item or coin purse left forgotten for you to pocket.</li><li><em>Reveal</em>: If you have a hunch that a certain something is hidden in this environment, such as a hidden entrance, invisible object, or illusive creature, you can make a Wisdom (Investigation) check to learn the location or general location of it or its last location. You do not learn that it is not here if you fail the check. DC depends on the environment&rsquo;s density, the size of the target, and if it&rsquo;s in motion.</li><li><em><em>Scour</em>:</em> Obtain enough food to feed yourself tonight, if any exist in the environment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guide:</strong> As a <em>Long Rest Action</em>, you can turn a book or unfilled paper into a Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guide, adding one chapter to it in the process. <br />Any creature that can read the Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guide can study up to 3 chapters of it as a short rest, gaining each chapter&rsquo;s benefits until their next rest. Bonuses from chapters cannot be stacked, and each physical chapter can only be studied by one creature per rest.</li><li><strong>Expand Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guide:</strong> With a Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guide in hand, you can add additional chapters to it as a <em>Long Rest Action</em>, each chapter taking up one sheet of paper (or two pages) each:&nbsp;</li><ul><li><strong>Geographical Map:</strong> You calligraph a simple map of the area most fitting to a 6-mile diameter.<ul><li><em>Requirement:</em> Use <em>Explore Area</em> to learn at least three aspects about the area.</li><li><em>Effect:</em> While traveling, you move through this area in half the time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Notated Map:</strong> You update your Geographical Map to notate local resources and landmarks.</li><ul><li><em>Requirements:</em></li><ul><li>Have a Geographical Map of the area.</li><li>Use <em>Explore Area</em> to learn at least five aspects about the area.</li></ul><li><em>Effect: </em>While in the area of the map, you have a +2 to finding natural resources and notable unnatural landmarks in the area.</li></ul><li><strong>Flora Guide:</strong> You press the flora into the book, supplementing it with additional sketches and notes about prime spots for it to grow.<ul><li><em>Requirement:</em> One of the flora from the area in question, pressed into the page when you create this chapter.</li><li><em>Effect: </em>You have a +2 to skill checks to find a specific type of flora again.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fauna Guide:</strong> You sketch the creature and add notable observations about its biology and behavior.<ul><li><em>Requirement:</em> Succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Instinct) check toward a creature you can see within 15 ft of you. Upon failure, you cannot try again for the next 1 hour.</li><li><em>Effect:</em> You have a +2 to uncontested skill checks against the creature.<ul><li>Fauna Guides cannot be made for societal creatures, such as player races (humans, zhier, chk&rsquo;tu, etc.).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Hunting Guide:</strong> You add more details to the creature sketch, highlighting weak points and noting useful hunting tactics.</li><ul><li><em>Requirements:</em></li><ul><li>Have a <em>Fauna Guide</em> for the creature.</li><li>You must have slain or defeated a creature of this type at least once.</li></ul><li><em>Effect:</em> You have a +1 to attack rolls and damage against a creature, and +2 to checks to harvest anything from it or its corpse.<ul><li>Making a Hunting Guide for societal creatures, such as player races (humans, zhier, chk&rsquo;tu, etc.), grants no bonus to attack or damage.</li></ul></li></ul><li><strong>Star Chart:</strong> You chart the stars, noting the directions and angles based on the changing seasons.<ul><li><em>Requirement:</em> View the stars at night in the area at least once.</li><li><em>Effect: </em>While you can see the stars at night, you have both a +2 to checks to navigate and a +1 to Wisdom (Save) checks.</li></ul></li></ul></ul>",
