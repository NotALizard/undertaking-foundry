            "value": "<p>Each Fishing Kit includes the following common equipment pieces:</p><ul><li>@Compendium[undertaking.adventuring-gear.CZ8HJ72W4FPANI8N]{Basic Fishing Rod}</li><li>Crustacean Trap (@Compendium[undertaking.adventuring-gear.A0FTPHU6A21A6A54]{Small Cage})</li><li>@Compendium[undertaking.adventuring-gear.IEUYP3X451NCPZ4M]{Net}</li><li>10x @Compendium[undertaking.adventuring-gear.W5YKJZ4ROL2LNOZE]{Fishing Bait}</li></ul><p>Fishing rods come in varying levels of quality. Any quality of fishing rod can be used with actions in this trade that specify the use of a fishing rod.&nbsp;</p><p>With Fishing Proficiency, you can do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Craft Makeshift Fishing Equipment:</strong> You are well-versed with the function of various fishing equipment, and in a pinch you can use basic materials to create makeshift versions of this equipment good enough to make do.</li><ul><li><em>Fashion a Rod:</em> As a <em>Rest Action</em>, you can create a Poor Fishing Rod using any wooden branch or pole and 10ft of either rope or string.</li><li><em>Fashion a Net:</em> As a <em>Long Rest Action</em>, you can weave and tie 50ft of rope into a Net suitable for fishing.</li></ul><li><strong>Gather Bait:</strong> As a <em>Rest Action</em> in any location with vegetation, you can search for insects and invertebrates that are suitable for use as fishing bait. Make an Intelligence (Nature) check against DC 8. On a success, you find 1d4 Fishing Bait. You find 1 additional piece of Fishing Bait for every 3 your roll exceeds the DC by.</li></ul><p>With Fishing Proficiency, you can use parts of the Fishing Kit to attempt to catch fish through various means. The kit can be used in the following ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Subsistence Fisher:</strong> Any fish caught as part of a <em>Long Rest Action</em> can be cooked and eaten during the same long rest. Caught fish begin to spoil if not consumed by the end of the next long rest.</li><li><strong>Set a Trap:</strong> As a <em>Long Rest Action</em> within a short walk of a body of water or liquid, you can use up to 3 pieces of Fishing Bait (which are consumed) and either a net or small cage in order to catch multiple fish. If the body of water you set the trap in contains fish, you are able to attract 1d4 fish for each piece of bait you used. When hauling in the trap, you capture all of the fish that were attracted with a successful Strength (Athletics) or Wisdom (Instinct) check against DC 12. On a failure, you only catch half of the fish and the rest escape. Each fish you catch can be cooked to feed one creature.</li><li><strong>Prize Fishing:</strong> As a <em>Rest Action</em> next to a body of water or liquid, or a <em>Long Rest Action</em> within a short walk from one, you can attempt to catch an exceptional fish. In order to fish in this way, you need to be holding a fishing rod and expend one piece of fishing bait. Each use of this action is resolved in the following steps:<ul><li><em><em>Gear Up:</em> Your current fishing score for this attempt starts equal to the base fishing score of the rod you are using.</em></li><li><em>Pick a Spot:</em> Increase your current fishing score by 1d4.</li><li><em>Cast Your Line:</em> Make a Strength (Athletics) check against DC 12. On a success, increase your current fishing score by 1. On a failure, decrease it by 1 instead.</li><li><em>Settle In:</em> Choose any prize level from the prize fishing table below to be your target prize level. This choice determines the final fishing score you will need in order to catch the fish, and what results a success will yield.</li><li><em>Something&rsquo;s Nibbling:</em> Roll 1d6 and add it to your current fishing score. You can now choose to shift your target prize level up or down by 1. You cannot change it after this step.</li><li><em>Reel It In:</em> Roll 1d8 and add it to your current fishing score. If your final fishing score meets or exceeds the fishing score needed for your target prize level, you successfully reel in the result for that prize level. Otherwise, the fish gets away with your bait.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>Prize Fishing Table</em></p><table><tbody><tr><th style=\"min-width: 10vmin;\"><p>Prize Level</p></th><th style=\"min-width: 10vmin;\"><p>Fishing Score Needed</p></th><th><p>Result on a Successful Catch</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p><strong>Nothing&rsquo;s Biting.</strong> You get your piece of fishing bait back.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p><strong>Just a Fish.</strong> You catch a common fish that can feed a single creature if cooked.
