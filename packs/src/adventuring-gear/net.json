            "value": "A net made out of hempen rope, often with metal weights attached.  As an action, you can attempt to ensnare a medium or smaller creature with the net.  Make a Grapple contest against the target.  If you win, the target is Restrained inside the net instead of Grappled.  A creature touching the net can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature on a success.  Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.",
