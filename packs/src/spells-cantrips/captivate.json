The target creature, while able to see you, has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to perceive any creature besides you.</p><p>In addition, the target must make a Wisdom (Save) check. On a failed save, the creature must include you as a target for any attacks and harmful spells or abilities it attempts until the end of its next turn. This effect only restricts the creature&rsquo;s valid targets, it does not (on its own) provoke hostility from a creature that otherwise would not be inclined to harm you.</p><p>All effects immediately end if the creature is attacked or harmed.</p>",
