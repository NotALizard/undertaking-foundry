So long as you can see the illusory object unobstructed, then you can re-form the image as a minor action, or move it up to a total of 30 feet per round, shared between each of your illusory objects, as a free action.  <ul><li>Simple illusions do not have intricate carvings, textures, or multiple parts.  A pocket watch might be a simple illusion, but no gears could be showing and it might lack a chain or any intricate designs.  </li></ul></li><li>Create one complex illusion that fits within 5 square feet.  So long as you can see the illusory object unobstructed, then you can re-form the image as an action, or move it up to a total of 15 feet per round as a minor action.  </li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These illusory objects cannot give off light, sound, smell, or any other sensory effect, and are revealed as illusions when physically interacted with since objects pass through them.  If a creature examines an illusion, it can succeed in determining that it\u2019s an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Spell Save DC.  Reduce the Spell Save DC by 3 for this roll if the illusory object is complex.  Attempting to simulate living creatures causes it to appear obviously illusory without the need to make a check.</p>",
