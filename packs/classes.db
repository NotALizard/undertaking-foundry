Often coming from gods, deities, and even belief itself, Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miracles on par with, if not beyond, the laws of reality itself.  These inscrutable forces may lend their powers to acolytes, but they remain selective in how they grant these powers.  Only through faith, dedication, and a personal relationship with the deity, deities, or forces of belief are true Clerics formed.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harnessing divine magic is more than just studying or training though.  A cleric might repeat habitual prayers and rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells requires devotion and an intuitive sense of their beliefs, even if not always exactly in sync with their benefactor or otherwise.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerics combine helpful healing and boons with divine destruction and smiting, provoking both awe and dread in those who stand against them.  Be it curses and plagues, smites from the heavens or hells, or even more personal and unique spells of their dominion, their variety of spellcasting capabilities may be enough for most situations.  However, their training in more traditional combat improves survival in just as many situations.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerics, as is the nature of their divine powers, begin by following at least one dominion of their deity or form of belief, expanding from there.

This means that Fighters can fit whatever role is necessary in a fight. However, their naturally high Hit Points and a general lack of diminishing abilities makes them great for longer battles than spellcasters who are limited by Mana, and their improved desperate actions and weapon abilities gives them more opportunities to save the party than almost any other class.
